Doom Emacs Configuration

Everyone loves a rolling release text editor / operating system that is infected with Vim!

This is my daily driver configuration with LSP support for various languages (lsp-mode & company-capf), terminal emulator (vterm), git (magit), email (mu4e + mbsync), and everything else magical about emacs!

## Installation
1. Install emacs (recommended version >= version 27)
2. Install doom-emacs, with `install.sh`
3. `git clone` this repository
4. Rename `doom-d` to `.doom.d`
5. Run `doom-sync`
6. Run `doom-doctor` and check `init.el` for various dependencies for emacs and LSP
